# IRIS-Flower-Classification
This repository contains code and resources related to my Iris flower classification project. The Iris flower dataset is a classic machine learning dataset used for classification tasks, making it an excellent choice for learning and experimentation.
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, based on certain flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

Key Features:

Implementation of various machine learning algorithms and models.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
Evaluation metrics and visualization tools to assess model performance.
Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for easy replication and experimentation.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the well-known Iris flower dataset, which is included in popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn.

Getting Started:
If you'd like to try the code or contribute to this project, you can start by cloning this repository and following the instructions provided in the README file.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to improve the existing code, add new features, or fix issues, please feel free to submit pull requests.
